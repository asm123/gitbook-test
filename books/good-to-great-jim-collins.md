# Good to Great - Jim Collins

* Book: [Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/76865)
* Author: Jim Collins
* Published in: 2001

### Official Summary

> This book addresses a single question: can a good company become a great company, and if so, how? Based on a five-year research project comparing companies that made the leap to those that did not, Good to Great shows that greatness is not primarily a function of circumstance but largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline. This book discusses concepts like Level 5 Leadership; First Who, Then What (first get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to drive it); the Hedgehog Concept, and the Flywheel.

### Chapter 3 - First Who... Then What

* Key point is not just the idea of getting the right people on the team. Main points are:
  1. _First_ get the right people on the bus, and wrong people off the bus. _Then_ figure out where to drive it.
  2. Degree of sheer rigor needed in people decisions to take a company from good to great.
* Avoid "a genius with a thousand helpers" model for hiring.
* Compensation is to keep the right people in the first place, instead of motivating right behaviours from wrong people.
* Good-to-great leaders are rigorous, not ruthless:
  * Rigorous = consistently apply exacting standards at all times and at all levels including upper management.
  * Ruthless = firing people without any thoughtful consideration.
* Disciplines for being rigorous, not ruthless:
  1. When in doubt, don't hire, keep looking.
  2. Act when you know you need to make a people change. Good-to-great companies did not churn more, they churned better.
  3. Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.

### Chapter 4 - Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)

* Continually refine the path to greatness with the brutal facts of reality.
* Charismatic personality can be as much as liability as an asset.
  * The strength of personality can deter people from bringing the brutal facts.
* Opportunity to "Have your say" vs opportunity "to be heard".
* Creating a climate where truth is heard:
  1. Lead with questions, not answers
     * Having humility to accept the fact that you do not understand enough to have the answers.
     * Asking questions that will lead to best possible insights.
     * Instead of coming up with answers and motivating everyone to follow that vision.
  2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion:
     * Debate in search for the best answers.
     * Instead of discussions to get a buy-in for a predetermined decision.
  3. Blameless autopsies:
     * You should almost never assign a blame.
     * Only search for understanding and learning.
  4. Build red flag mechanisms:
     * More or better information makes no different between good and great companies.
     * Turn the information into information that cannot be ignored.
* Stockdale Paradox
  * Retain the faith that you will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties.
  * At the sane time, confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.

### Chapter 5 - The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)

* Hedgehog conept: Understanding of what you can and cannot be the best at.
  * Know one big thing and stick to it.

* From https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html
* Deep passion: not to stimulate passion, but to discover what makes you passionate.
* Be the best in the world: not necessarily current competence.
* Economic engine: single denominator `x` with greatest impact on economics, go after profit per `x` or cash flow per `x`.

### Chapter 6 - A Culture of Discipline

* Bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline. Avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy, instead create a culture of discipline.
* Never just focus on what you've accomplished this year; focus on what you've accomplished relative to exactly what you decided to accomplish.
* Build a culture full of people who take disciplined action consistent with the Hedgehog Concept.
  * Disciplined people: Hire self-disciplined people.
  * Disciplined thought: Confront brutal facts of reality, retain faith that you can and will create a path to greatness. Persist the search for understanding until you get your Hedgehog Concept.
  * Disciplined action: Extreme diligence and stunning intensity. Fanatically adhere to the Hedgehog Concept.
* Develop a framework with clear constraints and give people freedom and responsibility within that framework.
* Disciplined culture != tyranny.
* Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity also has to fit in the three circles.
* Budgeting is a discipline to decide which arenas should be fully funded and which should not be funded at all.
* "Stop doing" list is more important that "to do" list.

### Chapter 7 - Technology Accelerators

* Technology is important, but technology alone cannot create sustainable results. It by itself is never a primary cause of either greatness or decline.
* Use technology as an _accelerator_ of the momentum, not a _creator_ for it.
  * Become a pioneer in the application of carefully selected technologies to link directly to the three circles of Hedgehog Concept.
  * It is a special case of Disciplined Action.
* Thoughtless reliance on technology is a liability.
* How a company reacts to technological change is a good indicator of its drive for greatness vs medocrity.
  * Great companies respond with thoughtfulness and creativity, driven by a compulsion to turn unrealized potential into results.
  * Mediocre companies react and lurch about, motivate by fear of being left behind.

### Chapter 8 - The Flywheel and the Doom Loop

* Good-to-great transformations are not results of one fell swoop or overnight success. They are organic development process, sometimes more than a decade in making.
*   Flywheel effect: Continued improvement and delivery, tangible accomplishments build up the momentum and attract the enthusiasm of people.

* The doom loop: Skipping the buildup phase and jumping right to breakthrough.
  *   Pushing flywheel in one direction, then stop, change course and throw it in a new direction again and again.

* Big acquisitions should take place after development of Hedgehog Concept and after the flywheel builds significant momentum.
  * Use acquisitions as an accelerator of flywheel momentum, not a creator of it.
* Consistency and coherence over time yield maximum results.

### Chapter 9 - From Good to Great to Built to Last

* This chapter links the ideas from the author's other book [_Built to Last_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4122.Built_to_Last) with the findings of this book.
* Key ideas from _Built to Last_:
  1. Clock building, not time telling: build an organization that can endure and adapt through multiple generations of leaders and product life cycles.
  2. Genius of AND: embrace both extremes on a number of dimensions at the same time, e.g., purpose AND profit, continuity AND change, freedom AND responsibility.
  3. Core ideology: instill core values and purpose to guide decisions and inspire people.
  4. Preserve the core / stimulate progress: set and achieve BHAG - _Big Hairy Audacious Goals_ - with the core ideology.
* Practically, _Good to Great_ serves as a prequel to _Build to Last_. Apply "Good to Great" principles to create sustained results and then apply "Build to Last" to be an enduring great company.
* Enduring great companies preserve their core values and purpose while endlessly adapting their business strategies and operating practices to a changing world.
* Core values are essential to greatness. It does not matter what core values you have, but that:
  1. you have core values at all,
  2. you know what they are,
  3. build them explicitly into the organization,
  4. preserve them over time.
* Bad BHAGs are set with bravado, good BHAGs are set with understanding - Hedgehog Concept.
* Enduring greatness requires staying squarely within three circles and also being willing to change the specific manifestation of what's inside the three circles at any given moment. For example, Boeing started with military jets and later included commercial aircrafts.
