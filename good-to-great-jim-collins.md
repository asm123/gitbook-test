### Chapter 3 - First Who… Then What <a href="#chapter-3---first-who-then-what" id="chapter-3---first-who-then-what"></a>

* Key point is not just the idea of getting the right people on the team. Main points are:
  1. _First_ get the right people on the bus, and wrong people off the bus. _Then_ figure out where to drive it.
  2. Degree of sheer rigor needed in people decisions to take a company from good to great.
* Avoid “a genius with a thousand helpers” model for hiring.
* Compensation is to keep the right people in the first place, instead of motivating right behaviours from wrong people.
* Good-to-great leaders are rigorous, not ruthless:
  * Rigorous = consistently apply exacting standards at all times and at all levels including upper management.
  * Ruthless = firing people without any thoughtful consideration.
* Disciplines for being rigorous, not ruthless:
  1. When in doubt, don’t hire, keep looking.
  2. Act when you know you need to make a people change. Good-to-great companies did not churn more, they churned better.
  3. Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.

### Chapter 4 - Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith) <a href="#chapter-4---confront-the-brutal-facts-yet-never-lose-faith" id="chapter-4---confront-the-brutal-facts-yet-never-lose-faith"></a>

* Continually refine the path to greatness with the brutal facts of reality.
* Charismatic personality can be as much as liability as an asset.
  * The strength of personality can deter people from bringing the brutal facts.
* Opportunity to “Have your say” vs opportunity “to be heard”.
* Creating a climate where truth is heard:
  1. Lead with questions, not answers
     * Having humility to accept the fact that you do not understand enough to have the answers.
     * Asking questions that will lead to best possible insights.
     * Instead of coming up with answers and motivating everyone to follow that vision.
  2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion:
     * Debate in search for the best answers.
     * Instead of discussions to get a buy-in for a predetermined decision.
  3. Blameless autopsies:
     * You should almost never assign a blame.
     * Only search for understanding and learning.
  4. Build red flag mechanisms:
     * More or better information makes no different between good and great companies.
     * Turn the information into information that cannot be ignored.
* Stockdale Paradox
  * Retain the faith that you will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties.
  * At the sane time, confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.

* From https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html
* Deep passion: not to stimulate passion, but to discover what makes you passionate.
* Be the best in the world: not necessarily current competence.
* Economic engine: single denominator `x` with greatest impact on economics, go after profit per `x` or cash flow per `x`.
