### Other notes from the book

* Koh-i-noor means "Mountain of Light" and originally weighed 190.3 metric carats. Other notable diamonds: Darya-i-Noor meaning "Sea of Light" weighing 175-195 metric carats (now In Tehran) and the Great Mughal Diamond aka Orlov weighing 189.9 metric carats (now in Kremlin).
* Kohinoor was originally the "size of a hen's egg".
* Until the discovery of Diamond mines in Brazil in 1725, with the sole exception of a few black diamond crystals found in the mountains of Borneo, all the world's diamonds came from India.
* Tiny Indian diamonds were used in polishing and cutting tools in ancient Egypt as early as 2000 BCE.
* According to Bhagavad and Vishnu Puranas, the greatest of Indian jewels was 'Syamantaka', the prince of gemstones. It is said to be a huge diamond or a ruby, a gem that provoked envy, greed and violence in those who coveted it.
* The world's oldest treatises on gems and gemmology were written in ancient India, pre-dating Puranas. They show remarkably detailed knowledge of the color and hiding place of gems.
* Vijayanagara was the supposed location of the largest diamonds in India according to the portuguese doctor and natural philosopher Garcia da Orto. Da Orto was the author of the third book ever printed in India, _Collquies on the Simples and Drugs of India_.
* Mughals liked 'red stones of light' (rubies) more than diamonds. Persian literature regarded such stones to be symbols of the divine in metaphysics and of the highest reaches of the sublime in art, evoking the light of dusk, _shafaq_. This came as a surprise to Europeans.
* Mughals liked their gems as close to their natural state and original size as possible.
* The value of Shah Jahan's Peacock Throne was 200 lacs of rupees at that time.
