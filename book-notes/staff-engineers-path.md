# Staff Engineer's Path

_Book:_ [_The Staff Engineer's Path_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) _by_ [_Tanya Reilly_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyareilly/)

![Book cover](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781098118723/250w/)

### Synopsis

Three pillars of staff engineer role:

1. Big-picture thinking
2. Execution of projects
3. Leveling up the engineers you work with

Technical knowledge is not enough at this level. You need "humaning skills" such as communication, leadership, navigating complexity, perspective, delegation, mentorship, sponsorship, framing a problem so that other people care about it.

> All of these skills are learnable.

### Chapter notes

* Chapter 3. Creating the Big Picture - describes the pre-work in preparing technical vision and strategy docs.
* Chapter 4. Finite Time - guides on choosing projects with impact and managing one's resources.
* Chapter 5. Leading Big Projects - guides on leading projects from start to end, and navigating roadblocks.

***

### Chapter 1. What Would You Say You Do Here?

#### Synopsis

* Philosophy of a staff role
  * See the big picture.
  * Lead projects that cross multiple teams.
  * Be a good influence - set standards with good behaviour, code and design reviews.
* Defining the role, scope, shape and focus.

***

#### What is the job?

* Involved and invested in growing technical skills of engineers around them, but not responsible for managing their performance.
* Leadership - designing solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes, reviewing code and designs, setting technical direction.
  * _Having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people because they trust you._
* Solid foundation of technical skills.
  * Have high standards for engineering excellence and model them while building.
  * Take on ambiguous, difficult problems and do just enough work to make them manageable by someone else -> make it a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers.
  * What matters is that problems get solved, not how.
* Be autonomous
  * Manager brings you information and share context, you tell them what's important and create the high-impact work.
  * Bring your expertise to your decisions.
  * Be responsible - speak up if you foresee a disaster with decisions.
* Set technical direction
  * Ensure decisions are made well and written down - there is an agreed upon, well-understood solution that solves the problem at hand.
* Communicate often and well - convey information and be understood.

#### Understanding the role

**Reporting structure**

* Reporting high: reporting to a director or VP.
  * 👍🏼 Gives broad perspective, access to high-level and impactful info, valuable learning experience.
  * 😔 Less time from manager, less visibility into the work -> less advocacy for growth, may feel disconnected from the rest of the team.
* Reporting low:
  * 👍🏼 Focused attention from manager -> more advocacy for growth
  * 😔 May be hard to influence the whole organization, access to filtered info, may have less to learn -> may not be helpful for career growth
  * ✅ Ensure to have meetings with skip-level manager, find ways to stay connected with org's goals.

**Scope**

* Should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals within your scope.
* Should have opinions about changes.
* Should help cultivate and develop next generation of senior and staff engineers, suggest projects to help them grow.
* Be clear about what your scope is: work at finer granularity, or operate at a high level and tie together all the work happening in the org.

> No such thing as "not my job" during a crisis. Part of the value of a staff engineer is that you don't stay in your lane.

* Too broad or undefined scope: lack of clear impact, becoming a bottleneck, constant cost of deciding which thing to do, missing friendly / mentorship connections with other engineers.
* Too narrow scope: lack of impact due to working on something that doesn't need the staff expertise, possibility of losing opportunities elsewhere in the org, not enough work to keep you busy -> overshadowing other engineers' work, overengineering due to lack of work.

> Choose an area, build influence, have success there. Devote time to solving problems entirely.

**Shaping the role**

* Do you approach things breadth-first or depth-first?
* Where do you gravitate - core technical skills, product management, project management, people management?
  * More senior you get, more there is an expectation of fluidly shifting between these 4 jobs and function in all of them.
* How much do you want to or need to code?
* How is your delayed gratification?
* Do you want to be a TLM?
* Do any of the staff archetypes fit you - tech leads, architects, solvers, right hands?

**Primary focus**

* What to choose:
  * At staff, everything you do has an opportunity cost -> work you do must be strategically important and meaningful.
  * Choose a problem that actually needs you and will benefit from your attention.
* What to avoid:
  * Projects with already many senior people on it.
  * Projects with more people being the wise voice of reason than those actually working on it.

#### Action Items

* Figure out if your mental model of your role is aligned with the expectations of your manager and colleagues.
  * Write out your understanding of your role and check with the manager if the expectations are aligned - primary focus, goals, example responsibilities, success criteria.

### Chapter 2. Three Maps

#### Synopsis

* The maps to have continual context and a sense of what is going on:
  1. Locator map: your place in the wider organization and company.
  2. Topographical map: navigating an organization - robust knowledge of what's ahead - how leaders operate, how decisions are made, org charts.
  3. Treasure map: taking a long view and evaluating the purpose of your work.

***

#### Locator map: getting perspective

* Risks of being too focused on work in your own scope:
  1. Prioritizing badly - focusing on only local maximum
  2. Losing empathy - considering other teams' work unimportant
  3. Tuning out the background noise - stopping to notice problems in your own domain
  4. Forgetting the purpose of your work - losing sight of whole picture and if the project is still required
* How to see the bigger picture?
  * Take an outsider view of your own group - do technical decisions make sense?
  * Seek out peers in other groups, build friendly relationships with other staff engineers within and outside the org, find out if there are any negative opinions about your group. Befriend non-eng folks such as product, customer support, admins.
  * Know implicit as well as explicit goals that matter to the company/org right now.
  * Measure success from user's point of view.
  * Study what other have already done for this problem within and outside the org.
* How to keep seeing the big picture with changing priorities - pay attention to all-hands, have 1:1s with the skip, find face time with customers and dependent teams.

#### Topographical map: navigating the organization

* Difficulties without a topographical map:
  * Good ideas don't get traction - should know how to build momentum within the org, who can sponsor the idea.
  * Not finding out about difficulties until getting there.
  * Everything takes longer - should know times of year when decision making is quicker.

**Understanding the organization**

* Seven attributes to understand the culture:
  1. Secret or open - how much does everyone know.
  2. Oral or written - how much writing and review is involved in decisions.
  3. Top-down or bottom-up
  4. Fast change or deliberate change - frame initiatives accordingly.
  5. Fast - incremental path that shows value immediately
  6. Deliberate - show that you've thought through the whole plan
  7. Communication channels
  8. Staffing
  9. Understaffed - better impact working alone or with little help.
  10. Many free cycles - better impact if choosing and finishing a nascent project and convincing others to rally it around.
  11. Liquid or crystallized
  12. Liquid: more room to change your place in the org, but need to hustle for promotion.
  13. Crystallized: need to know your place and when your time will come for a promo project.
* What do leaders consider important - figure out from how efforts are rewarded or rewarded, and resources are allocated.
* How does information flow in the org?
  * Pathologically - power and status are goals -> people hoard info, low co-operation.
  * Bureaucratically - standard channels, rule-oriented -> change is difficult
  * Generatively - mission-oriented, high-trust, high co-operation.

**Notice points of interest**

* Understand points of interest = barriers, difficult parts of journey, shortcuts.
* Points of interest:
  * Gaps between teams in terms of culture, practices, goals.
  * Gatekeepers that seem to block projects. Get a sponsor for help, prove that you've mitigated all the risks.
  * Lack of alignment, overlapping responsibilities -> power struggles and wasted efforts.
  * A project may have been tried before and found unwinnable - should have enough evidence to convince that it can be won.
  * Shortcuts and long ways around - official way of solving may not be the best, shortcuts may be unknown or undocumented.
* How are decisions made?
  * Consistently feeling out of loop -> you don't understand how decisions are made and who influences them.
  * Need to convince _right_ people.
  * Finding the "room" where decisions are made - weekly manager's meeting, director's meeting, group chats, senior 1:1s.
  * Joining the room:
    * Reasons to join the room should be impactful to the org, not to you personally.
    * Don't make anyone regret inviting you. Reduce the cost of joining: be prepared, speak concisely, be low-friction and collaborative.
  * The "room" may have less power than you think.
* Shadow org chart - who influence the technical leaders and how they make decisions.
  * Identify the influencers and get their buy-in.
* Keeping map up-to-date: announcements and mailing lists, connect with teams around, lookup leads' calendars, meeting notes, group chats, read PRDs, design docs, meet with leads, coffee chats.
* Networking is important - ask questions, compliment, coffee chats.
* Bridge connections
  * Sending email summary, write documentations that show how projects connect.
  * Define the work scope so that it encompasses all or some system or problem domain - helps get context to form opinions on decisions.

#### Treasure map: where are we going?

* Need perspective about the world around across time.
* Don't think only about short-term wins. Take a longer view as well.
* Choose technology _to reach the real goal_.
* Share the treasure map with others.

#### Action Items

* Understand how my org works.
* Start building the three maps for my work.

### Chapter 3. Creating the Big Picture

#### Synopsis

* Creating the missing map:
  * Technical vision - the future you want to get to
  * Technical strategy - how to get there
* Chapter talks about the need for these documents, preparation work for writing them, getting alignment and launching.

***

#### Decentralized decision making

* Pros:
  * Organizations can move quickly.
  * Make own decisions.
* Cons:
  * Local maximum without coordinating with other leads.
  * No one group as authority or incentive -> shared concerns can be neglected.
  * Context missing for decision making.

#### Technical Vision

* Describes the future (aka north star) once problems are solved and objectives are achieved.
  * Creates a shared reality.
  * Removes sources of conflict or ambiguity.
* What does a technical vision include:
  * A description of high-level values and goals
  * A set of principles to use for making decisions
  * A summary of decision already made
  * An architectural diagram

> Should be clear, opinionated and meet organization's needs.

#### Technical Strategy

* Clean plan for action to achieve the goals and tackling challenges in the path.
  * Address specific challenges in realistic ways
  * Provide strong direction
  * Define actions to be prioritized along the way
  * Should draw on your advantages - amplify advantages in self-reinforcing way (🤔 didn't quite understand this part).
* Kernel of a strategy:
  1. Diagnosis of the problem - what's going on here.
  2. Guiding policy - clear directions to bypass the obstacles.
  3. Coherent actions - specific actions to be taken and not to be taken. These are the actions to which time and resources should be committed.

> Should be realistic and acknowledge the constraints of your situation.

#### When are vision and strategy documents required?

* Path is undefined and confusing.
* Goals are not clear.
* Tough to get alignment from the group on a plan.

> Writing these documents is time-consuming. If same can be achieved in a lightweight way, go that way instead.

#### Approach to creating the documents

* Be prepared to involve existing ideas.
  * Weigh up all possible solutions, make the case for what to do and not to do, align everyone and make the decision.
* Don't compete if someone else is already working on creating a similar document. Find ways to collaborate - share the lead, follow the lead or step away.
  * Practice perspective: is their direction wrong, or just different?
  * Try to join the existing journey and change direction instead of setting up competition from scratch.
* Get a sponsor.
  * Sponsor helps clarify and justify the work, adds hierarchy to groups to get consensus, sets success criteria, acts as a tiebreaker for stuck decisions.
  * Maximize chances to get a sponsor by bringing something they want - match the proposal to the sponsor's own goals or problems they care about. Maybe align to the organization's treasure map.
  * Practice the "elevator pitch" of 50 words before trying to convince the sponsor.
  * A sponsor needs the power to decide what an org spends time and staffing on - usually a director or VP.
  * Maintain the sponsorship.
* Choose the working groups:
  * Core group - 2-4 people - to create the document
    * Use the topographical map to identify who should be on your side, who might oppose. Bring along the potential opposers on your side from the start.
    * Be clear and highlight _from the start_ whether you are the lead of the group or an equal peer.
  * Broad group - lightweight involvement - for alignment and support
    * Keep them enagaged: interview them and represent their point of view in the work
    * Send them updates on the progress on the document.
    * Invite to review the early draft.
*   Set scope:

    * Be conscious of your skill level and scope of influence.
    * If the plan covers areas outside of your sphere of influence, make sure to have a sponsor with influence in that area - ideally in the core group for that area.
    * Keep revisiting the vision at intervals to ensure it is still aligned with the organization's direction.
    * Choose the document type and format that makes sense to you and _the sponsor_.

    > Work around your fixed constraints instead of ignoring them or wishing they were different.
* Make sure it is achievable - is the problem solvable at all? Is it solvable by you? If not:
  * Work with someone who has the skills to solve - lead or co-lead with them.
  * Rescope the problem as per the constraints.
  * Work on something else if it is ok for the org/company to not have this problem solved.
* Make it official:
  * Do not continue if any of the above is not possible.
  * Formally set up kickoff documentation, milestones, timelines and expectations for reporting progress.

#### Writing the document

* Revisit the document regularly to see what context has changed.

**Writing**

* Initial ideas
  * Inherit the constraints from broader visions and strategies. Use the locator map.
  * Include paths to success for the organization's existing plans, be aware of smaller scope documents to understand the potential disruptions.
  * Understand what is difficult and needs to change, where should your group be investing.
  * Ensure to retain the things that are currently working well.
  * What is important, what matters?
  * What will future you wish that present you had done?
* Writing - possible ways
  1. Have the leader write the first draft for discussion - talk to the group before starting to write.
  2. Aggregate multiple first drafts - set expectations about who will write the final version and mediate disagreements.
* Interviews
  * Talk to leaders, influencers and people close to the work in other areas - value their ideas and include them in the document.
  * Ask open-ended questions for scoping and framing.
* Thinking
  * Check motivations - are you describing a problem in terms of the solution you have already chosen?
  * Ask "but why?" over and over again until you are sure the explanation maps back to the goal to be achieved.

**Make decisions**

* Clarify and weigh trade-offs.
* Build consensus
  * Take a sense of the group, try to get aligned, but don't block on full consensus.
  * Instead of "Is everyone ok with choice A?", ask "Can anyone not live with choice A?".
  * Important to have someone with clear leadership authority that can act as a tiebreaker - can be the sponsor.
* Postponing or not deciding
  * What extra information do you expect to make a decision and how? What could go wrong? Can it be course-corrected?
  * Usually don't need to make the best decision, just a good enough decision.
  * Timebox if stuck.
  * When not to decide - if the investment is not worth the benefits, if mistakes carry heavy penalty, if situation can go away on its own. _Decide to not decide._
* Show your work - show why you chose what you chose, be clear about the disadvantages.

**Alignment**

* Keep the sponsor up to date on the plan and progress.
* Check the alignment at major checkpoints - diagnosis, guiding policy, actions.
*   Apply Overton window - an approach to identifying the ideas that define the spectrum of acceptability. Don't take on an unwinnable battle.

    | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
    | From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) |
* Nemawashi - quietly laying the foundation by talking to the people concerned and gathering support and feedback before a formal announcement.
  * Someone who will need to approve the plan should show up to any decision-making meeting already convinced.
* Tell a story that is comprehensible, relatable and comfortable.

**Final draft**

* Use personas, real scenario to describe people affected by vision and strategy - before and after.
* Be concrete, avoid jargon.
* Accompany with a second document - slide deck, one-page elevator pitch, blog post.

#### Launch

* Make it official.
  * Get endorsement from top of the people-manager chain: director, VP.
  * Ask the sponsor to sell the idea. Seek help for staffing - prioritization, headcount, OKR, budget.
* Keep it fresh - adapt the doc as per changing business context and priorities.

#### Action Items

* Read existing strategy docs within org.
* Observe how in-progress strategy docs are being written.

### Chapter 4. Finite Time

#### Synopsis

* Take on the work that is important to the company and important to you. Your needs are important and you are the person with the most incentive to watch out for them.
* Taking care of your needs is compatible with being a team player because you will do better work if the projects keep you happy.
* Five resources to manage: energy, quality of life, credibility, social capital, skills.
* Ways to amplify the positives, decrease the negatives, saying no.

***

#### Time

* Everything you commit to has an opportunity cost.
* Try to leave at least a little buffer space if you can for unplanned extra obligations.
  * If your schedule is filled with only important things, an unplanned event will cause hitting your limit and dropping something important.
  * Working beyond limits will cause stress and exhaustion.
  * Looking for longer-term needs a bigger picture of the month or quarter - a time graph.

#### Resource constraints

1. **Energy**: Understand what kinds of work are expensive to you in terms of energy and what kinds leave you with _smartbrain_ at the end of day - energy to stay focused on a piece of work and do something useful with it.
2. **Quality of life**: Not all of your quality of life should come from your work, but it is reasonable to want to feel good about it.
3. **Credibility**: Built by solving hard problems, being visibly competent and consistently showing good technical judgement.
   * ⬆ Taking a chaotic situation and making it easier for everyone to understand.
   * ⬇ Contributing to the chaos, not doing a good job of navigating the failure when a project goes badly, ignoring the big picture and business needs.
   * It is important to be aware of your credibility score and establish that you know what you are doing.
4. **Social capital**: Whether others want to help you do whatever you are trying to do.
   * It is a mix of trust, friendship and the feeling of owing someone a favor or believing that they will remember that they owe you one.
   * Invest your social capital wisely, spend it deliberately.
5. **Skills**: Always slowly decreasing. Increase the skills bar by deliberately setting out to learn something, working closely with someone skilled, learning by doing.

> You will optimize for different resources at different times. Pay attention to what any new project/task/initiative will do for each of your resources.

The bigger the project, the longer you should spend thinking about whether it is a good fit in terms of your resources.

#### Choosing projects

* Evaluating a project:
  * Go ask for the project if you want if you think you are the best fit for it.
  * Helping out in a crisis is often the right thing to do. But doing too much of it can make it hard to find opportunities for growth.
  * When blocked on a bigger work, solving small, easy problems on the side can be a great way to build up momentum again. Too much of this kind of work can keep you away from longer-term projects.
  * Working groups for a grassroots effort can be effective if buy-ins, commitments and decision processes are clear. Will be a waste of time if it is a big group of overallocated people without the power of changing things that bother them.
  * Some work doesn't belong to anyone. Volunteering for such work can build credibility and goodwill. Don't do too much of it at the expense of other results expected from you.

> Other people have limited access to your resource dashboard. You are responsible for taking care of your own resources.

* What are you signing up for?
  * Understand the shape of a new project/task/meeting (basically anything that blocks your time) and ask yourself what impact it will have on your time - both now and later.
  * Be cautious about time estimation. Account for about the time required for possibly preparing for this time commitment. For example, a 1 hour meeting may need some time for preparation as well, add that to the estimated time commitment.
  * Exit criteria are especially important for risky work.
* Questions to ask yourself about projects:
  * **Energy**:
    * How many things are you already doing?
    * Does this kind of work boost or drain your energy?
      * Do not snack&#x20;
    * Is this fight worth it?
  * **Quality of life**:
    * Do you enjoy this work? - intense and high stakes vs predictable, working alone vs collaborating with group(s), will you get to work with people who make you comfortable and safe?
    * How do you feel about the project's goals? Understand the positive and negative effects of your work on the world and weigh up how it affects your own satisfaction.
  * **Credibility**: Does this project use you technical and leadership skills?
  * **Social capital**:
    * Is this the kind of work expected by your manager and company at your level?
      * Help your boss be successful - Understand their priorities, give them the information they need, solve the problems in their way. Their success gives them the social capital that they can spend to help you. Manage up!
    * Will this work be respected?
    * Are you squandering the social capital you have built?
  * **Skills**:
    * Will this project teach you something you want to learn?
    * Will the people around you raise your game? - Look at whether you'll work for people you'll learn something from and people who will inspire you to do your best work.
* What if it is the wrong project? Possible approaches:
  * Do it anyway - popular, but not sustainable in long-term.
  * Accept the project and compensate the needs it does not meet with a side-project.
  * Delegate and let someone else lead.
  * Resize and reshape the project in a way that can work for you.
  * Just don't do it. Learn to say no.

> When you choose a project, make sure you have enough of the resources you will need to do a good job. Defend you time, be deliberate about what you prioritize.

#### Action Items

* Understand my current resource dashboard.
* Chart out resource dashboard for upcoming projects.
* Estimate the time for all the tasks this week / month considering the preparation time.

### Chapter 5. Leading Big Projects

#### Synopsis

* Context:
  * Staff engineer may have other leads involved in the big project (PMs, managers, senior engineers).
  * Nobody reports to the staff engineer.
  * Staff engineer is responsible for the result and is thinking about the whole problem.
* Techniques for:
  * Making sense of the problem.
  * Creating relationships for collaboration.
  * Setting the project up for success with goals, plans for deliverables and accountability.
  * Driving the project.

***

#### The start of a project

* It is normal to feel overwhelmed while beginning a project.
  * > That feeling of discomfort is called learning. - Polina Giralt
  * Imposter syndrome feeling -> stress, anxiety.
    * Check if any of the resources are at worrying levels.
    * Internalize that this is the nature of the work and the job is to be brave enough to make mistakes and own them.
* Making a new project less overwhelming:
  * Create an anchor for yourself with document of all the braindump for the project.
  * Talk to the project sponsor to align on the mission of the project, your role and expectations.
  * Find someone who can be a sounding board when the project is difficult. These should not be the junior engineers - shield them from ambiguity and fears, provide them safety.
  * Take any step that would help you exert some control over the problem.
  * Use your strengths to make progress, e.g., jump into code, read docs, talk to people.
* Build the context by building the three maps.
* Clarify the following for yourself and everyone else:
  * Goals:
    * Understand the why.
  * Customer needs:
    * Be obsessed with customer needs, business context, key metrics and customer experience.
  * Success metrics:
    * Set up objective metrics, get real and measurable goals in place quickly, ensure leads and sponsors are on the same page.
  * Sponsors, stakeholders and customers.
  * Constraints to set the right expectations:
    * Describe the reality of the situation you are in to avoid being mad at reality for not being as you wish it to be.
  * Risks:
    * Frequent iterative changes have a better chance of getting user feedback and course-correcting than a single win-or-lose release at the end.
  * Historical context:
    * Origin of the project, past attempts. Have a lot of conversations to find out dependencies, workarounds, people's feelings and expectations, learn from others' experiences.
  * Stakeholders and leads:
    * Build good working relationships, understand their role and involvement.
* Give your project a structure:
  * Define roles: Beginning of the project is the best time to lay out each leader's responsibilities.
    * Responsibility assignment matrix:
      * Responsible - the person actually doing the work.
      * Accountable - the person ultimately delivering the work and responsible for signing off that it's done. Should be only one per task.
      * Consulted - people who are asked for their opinion.
      * Informed - people to be kept up to date on progress.
  * Recruit people for roles you don't want to do or do not have time to do.
  * Agree on scope - decide what you're doing first, set a milestone and assign a deadline.
    * Make the increments small enough that there is always a milestone in sight.
  * Estimate time
  * Agree on logistics - meetings, communication modes, sharing status, documentation location, development practices.
  * Have a kickoff meeting.

#### Driving a project

> Driving cannot be passive. It is an active, deliberate, mindful role. It means choosing your route, making decisions, and reacting to hazards on the road ahead. If you're the project lead, you're in the driver's seat. You're responsible for getting everyone safely to the destination.

* Exploring:
  * What are the important aspects of the project? - what are you trying to achieve, what will be different once you've achieved it, what approach are you taking - build a crisp definition of what you're doing.
  * What possible approaches can you take? - figure out what you'll do _only_ once you have a clear story for what you are trying to do. Be open to existing solutions, learn from history - successes and failures.
* Clarifying:
  * Give everyone mental models for what you're all doing - help them connect the project concepts back to something they already understand.
  * Provide a glossary, be deliberate about describing the terms used.
  * Visualize.
* Designing:
  * Write things to down in design docs or RFCs to ensure everyone is on the same page.
    * Mention context, goals, design, security / privacy / compliance, alternatives considered, prior art, background, trade-offs, risks, dependencies, operations.
    * Readers should understand what you intend to do and should be able to tell you whether they think it will work.
  * Technical pitfalls:
    * Assuming the problem being solved is brand-new
    * Not internalizing the complexity of something
    * Building only for the present
    * Building for the distant, distant future
    * Ignoring the difficult part of the project for later
    * Solving the small problem by making the big problem more difficult
    * Not making systems operable - observable, debuggable, self-documenting processes.
    * Discussing the most trivial decisions the most while not engaging at all with the ones that are harder to grasp or to find consensus on.
  * Coding:
    * Staying involved in the implementation ensures that you feel the cost of your own architectural decisions. Coding at the expense of more difficult, important things is snacking.
    * Think of your code as a lever to help everyone else. Be an exemplar, but not a bottleneck.
    * Rather than taking on every important change yourself, find opportunities for other people to grow.
  * Communicating:
    * Find opportunities for team members to talk to each other regularly and build relationships. It should feel easy to reach out, ask questions, disagree without getting tense.
    * Make it easy for stakeholders to know the current status of the project via 1:1, regular email updates, project dashboards.
      * Explain the status in terms of impact and think about what the audience will actually want to know.
      * If your project is stuck, don't hide it. Ask for help.
  *   Navigating:

      * Things can go wrong. Less frustration if you go into the project assuming something is going to go wrong at some point.
      * Reframe the diversions as an opportunity to learn and have an experience you wouldn't have otherwise.
      * You are accountable for what happens when your project hits a roadblock - rerouting, asking for help, or declaring the goal unreachable.
      * Work with your team to figure out how you can navigate around it, communicate well, do not create panic. Give people facts and be clear about what to do with that information.

      > If you're stuck and need help, the biggest failure is not asking for it. Don't struggle alone.
