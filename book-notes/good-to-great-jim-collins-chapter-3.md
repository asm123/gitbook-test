# Good to Great - Jim Collins - Chapter 3

* Book: [Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/76865)
* Author: Jim Collins

### Official Summary

> This book addresses a single question: can a good company become a great company, and if so, how? Based on a five-year research project comparing companies that made the leap to those that did not, Good to Great shows that greatness is not primarily a function of circumstance but largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline. This book discusses concepts like Level 5 Leadership; First Who, Then What (first get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to drive it); the Hedgehog Concept, and the Flywheel.

### Chapter 3 - First Who... Then What

* Key point is not just the idea of getting the right people on the team. Main points are:
  1. _First_ get the right people on the bus, and wrong people off the bus. _Then_ figure out where to drive it.
  2. Degree of sheer rigor needed in people decisions to take a company from good to great.
* Avoid "a genius with a thousand helpers" model for hiring.
* Compensation is to keep the right people in the first place, instead of motivating right behaviours from wrong people.
* Good-to-great leaders are rigorous, not ruthless:
  * Rigorous = consistently apply exacting standards at all times and at all levels including upper management.
  * Ruthless = firing people without any thoughtful consideration.
* Disciplines for being rigorous, not ruthless:
  1. When in doubt, don't hire, keep looking.
  2. Act when you know you need to make a people change. Good-to-great companies did not churn more, they churned better.
  3. Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.
