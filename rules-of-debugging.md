# Rules of Debugging

1. As _**The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy**_ commands, Don't Panic.
2. Have confidence that you will figure it out.
3. Document observations even if they were a dead-end. It is totally possible to run into the same rabbithole again - this time or another time.
4. You don't have to do it alone. Seek help wherever required - look up documentation, ask people, pair debug with someone. Get the help you need to make progress.
