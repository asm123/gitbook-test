3. Read up existing engineering documentation for immediate area or related areas
4. Fix documentation on the go
5. Add missing documentation
6. Try to contribute to low-hanging bugs / tasks from recent launches

#### As a seasoned team member

Situation: Seasoned team member, org priorities or projects are not finalized due to factors not under your direct control.

1. Revisit any low-hanging bugs / tasks previously left out (if still relevant)
2. Cleanup tech debt
3. If general direction of the org is known but projects are not yet formalized, ramp up on the related areas through documentation, code
4. Educate others on the areas with lightning talks or 1:1 discussions

6. Use your product to check if it is still true to expectations
7. Add observability into launched features if still relevant
