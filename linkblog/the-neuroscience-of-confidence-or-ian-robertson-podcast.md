Listened to this highly motivating podcast on "10% Happier with Dan Harris" yesterday. Quite interesting is the "Oscar Effect" mentioned by the neuroscientist Ian Robertson (guest on the podcast) which states that Oscar winners tend to live longer than the nominees. Similar effect holds for Nobel prize winners.

This according to him is because an actor who wins the award may worry less about failing or not being recognized because by winning the Oscar, they have been taken out of the rat race of competitive evaluation.

Though, I do wonder, wouldn't the stress buildup, possibly of several years, until they win the award counter some of it?
