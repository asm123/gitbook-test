# Just give the man the fish!

Well said! StackOverflow used to be full of such behaviour when I tried asking questions there a few years ago. I love this takeaway from the article:

> If one really wants people to read the manual, a much better strategy would be to answer the question, and then having established oneself as a helpful person, suggest the manual.

That said, in my experience, this works only with people who are willing to refer the suggested manual next time they have a related question. A few times, I have had to work with people who would _never_ use that suggestion and instead would have to be handheld and spoonfed all the time.

**Edit (2025-02-16):**

Top comments (not answers) on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45823734/visual-studio-code-formatting-for)StackOverflow question are prime examples of this "not giving the fish" behaviour. So there really does seem to be some value in using GenAI to get help on such asks, because at least so far, it doesn't judge.
