Wow! What an article! Talks about this omnipresent font named "Gorton", its origins, history, travel and current omnipresence. I wish I was as passionate about something as this person is about fonts. Took me almost an hour to read it completely, admittedly I did skim over a few paragraphs towards the end. But really, what an article!
