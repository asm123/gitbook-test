# I Took a 'Decision Holiday' and Put A.I. in Charge of My Life

[I Took a 'Decision Holiday' and Put A.I. in Charge of My Life](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/01/technology/generative-ai-decisions-experiment.html?unlocked_article_code=1.W04.5jXN.Hi3GKDum5MTG\&smid=url-share)

An interesting read about Kashmir Hill's one week experiment with letting generative AI make decisions for her. Found it after listening to the [latest Hard Fork episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7BYM3Z4Aik\&list=PLB9gMmtMLXxsa8C0PzHFL2tJFh7FrKrYD\&index=1).

Some quotes from the article verbatim that resonated with me:

> We’ve been worried about a future where robots take our jobs or decide that humans are earth’s biggest problem and eliminate us, but an underrated risk may be that they flatten us out, erasing individuality in favor of a bland statistical average, like the paint color A.I. initially recommended for my office: taupe.

> Human effort matters to us, and anything secretly crafted, or decided, by machines feels like a deception.

> Could these tools help us make better decisions? Possibly! When used correctly. Could they help us make decisions more quickly? Definitely. Do we want to live in a world where we are using A.I. to make all our decisions all the time?
