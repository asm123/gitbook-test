# Sensitivity and Specificity

Computed from confusion matrix

$$Sensitivity = \frac {TP} {TP + FN}$$ = % of labels correctly identified in the positive class



$$Specificity = \frac {TN} {TN + FP}$$ = % of labels correctly identified in the negative class



$$Precision = \frac {TP} {TP + FP}$$ = % of labels correctly classified as positives



$$Recall = \frac {TP} {TP + FN} = Sensitivity$$
