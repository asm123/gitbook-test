# Logistic and Logit

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit)

If  $$p$$ is the probability, then $$\frac {p} {1-p}$$ is the corresponding odds.

Logit of the probability is the logarithm of the odds.

$$
logit(p) = ln(\frac {p} {1-p}) = -ln(\frac {1-p} {p}) = -ln({\frac {1} {p}} - 1)
$$
