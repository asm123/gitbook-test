### Level 1: Awkward

Self talk: My discomfort < colleague's embarrassment

Script:

1. Be direct.
2. Keep it discreet - do not tell them in front of other people.
3. Power up move: Practice on friends and family.

### Level 2: Alignment (or lack thereof)

Self talk: Walk in my colleague's shoes. Phrase the agrument from their standpoint, not just from my standpoint.

Script:

1. Empathize with the peer - state their position first to demonstrate the empathy.
2. State the misalignment openly.
3. Seek to get some input for alignment - suggest that it's ok to escalate and get input together if needed.

### Level 3: Apology

Self talk: Taking ownership will diffuse negative emotions.

Script:

1. Own the apology on behalf of the team.
2. Own the remediation for the problem.
3. Power up move: Ask for forgiveness. Reserved for times when personal harm is caused to someone in business.

### Level 4: Assessment / Feedback

Self talk: Resist the feedback sandwich - putting feedback between two compliments.

Script:

1. Note the behaviour that is holding them back. Explain why the behaviour is causing an important problem.
2. Ask them to reflect back the importance of that behaviour.
3. Let the person own the remediation to the problem, instead of suggesting what I would do.

### Level 5: Agonizing - delivering a news with negative impact

Examples: layoff, re-org, paygrade change.

Self talk: Empathize.

Script:

1. Acknowledge that the news is incredibly difficult.
2. Stop talking after delivering the news. Let the person respond.
3. Once they had time to process, offer to help them and really mean it.
